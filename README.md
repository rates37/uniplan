# Why

In early January, 2023, several Monash University students, including myself, became aware that the course planning tool 'MonPlan' would not be available after the 25th of January, as the University was developing a new course planning tool.

This expected shutdown date was quite an inconvenience, as this was right before the start of semester - the most common time that students would need such a tool, and so, at the encouragement from some of my peers, I began quickly developing an alternative tool that could be used in the meantime. The majority of features for this tool were developed in the span of 11/01/2023 - 16/01/2023.

While this tool has less features than MonPlan, is serves its purpose well enough and was a valuable learning experience for me to become aquatinted with React and front-end web development.
